This Python program separates the vowels from the rest of the characters in a user-provided statement.
The program works as follows:

Input: The user is prompted to enter a statement.
Vowel Check: The program checks each character in the statement to see if it is a vowel (a, e, i, o, u).
Separation: Vowels are stored in one string, and the rest of the characters (consonants, spaces, etc.) are stored in another.
Output: The program prints the list of vowels and the rest of the statement separately.
